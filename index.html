            As of Summer 2022 I have started my professional developer career. 
            I am currently working as a Software Engineering Intern for Cvent.
            After my first week, it has been a real eye-opener. It has shown me how
            important some of the tools I have been taught come to play in everyday scenarios.
            It was a small morale boost being one of the few interns who were familiar with
            so many of the tools they use daily such as Maven and Jenkins.
